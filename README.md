# mandala_quicksilver
Rust library to parse and display an SVG in quicksilver v0.3

This was created for a science display but may be useful in other projects

Example of use:
'''
cargo run --example display_mandala
'''

If targeting quicksilver v0.3 on Jetson Nano or Raspberry Pi, edit 'Cargo.toml' as labeled there. This is a minimum-effort hack regarding upstream dependencies that should disappear as libraries progress.
